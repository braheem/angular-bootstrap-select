# AngularBootstrapSelect

An example project to demonstrate how bootstrap-select (https://github.com/silviomoreto/bootstrap-select) can be wrapped in a directive to use throughout your app in an 'Angular' way.

This has only been tested to work with Angular 4. Since bootstrap-select does not officially support Bootstrap4, I used a shim repo (https://github.com/heimrichhannot/bootstrap-select) that seems to work with Bootstrap4-beta2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
